/**
 * Settle one payment at a time, and retry once when the facilitator loses a nonce race.
 *
 * The public facilitator submits every settlement from one relayer account. Two settlements in flight at once get the
 * same account nonce, and the chain rejects the second ("replacement transaction underpriced"): the run succeeded,
 * the payer is not charged, and the answer is thrown away. Measured 2026-10-07 with two parallel chat tool calls.
 * Retrying is safe: the payer's EIP-3009 authorization carries its own nonce, so it can land at most once.
