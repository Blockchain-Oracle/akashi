"""NASA providers: api.nasa.gov (NeoWs) and science.nasa.gov, where APOD now lives.

APOD now lives on science.nasa.gov: apod.nasa.gov redirects there, and api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod answers
every date with a "NASA Science" placeholder page (checked 2026-10-07). nasa/apod therefore reads the APOD
articles from science.nasa.gov's WordPress REST API, through a second provider so that host gets its own client
and no api.nasa.gov key is ever sent to it.
