"""akashi/answer: a Perplexity-style cited answer built from live sources inside one 8 s run.

Pipeline: Google results (serper/search) → the top pages read concurrently (jina/read, each failure tolerated)
→ gpt-oss-120b on Groq writes a short answer only from those sources, citing them as [n]. Every stage gets a
slice of what is left of the run deadline; when page reads run late the answer is written from the search
snippets instead, and the envelope says so.
