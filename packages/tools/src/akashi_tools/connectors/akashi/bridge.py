"""Bridge from the live-facts library (akashi_now) to the tool engine.

akashi_now services raise akashi_core errors and return `(results, sources, unavailable[, notes])`. Here those
errors become the engine's run outcomes (a missing place or entity is a not-found answer, a bad argument is
invalid input, an upstream that did not answer is a provider error), and sources, notes and unavailable sources
reach the envelope. The services read the run's deadline from the ContextVar the engine sets.
